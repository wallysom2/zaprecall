## Project Description
<p align="justify">My second project at Driven Education Bootcamp using React was implementing a flashcard app called Zap Recall!  Flashcards are cards that contain a question/statement in front of them and an answer on the back. You can use them to pratice your memory with Active Recall and Spaced Repetition methodologies.
The idea is to read the question or statement and try to remember the answer. When faced with it, depending on the effort required to respond or not to the flashcard, you become aware of which contents are fresh in your memory and which are not, so you can often practice the contents that are not.
When we instantly remember a flashcard, we get a "Zap!"⚡</p>
